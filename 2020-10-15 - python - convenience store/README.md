Convenience Store
Given a total due and an array representing the amount of change in your pocket, determine whether or not you are able to pay for the item. Change will always be represented in the following order: quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies.

To illustrate: changeEnough([25, 20, 5, 0], 4.25) should yield true, since having 25 quarters, 20 dimes, 5 nickels and 0 pennies gives you 6.25 + 2 + .25 + 0 = 8.50.

Examples
changeEnough([2, 100, 0, 0], 14.11) ➞ false

changeEnough([0, 0, 20, 5], 0.75) ➞ true

changeEnough([30, 40, 20, 5], 12.55) ➞ true

changeEnough([10, 0, 0, 50], 3.85) ➞ false

changeEnough([1, 0, 5, 219], 19.99) ➞ false
Notes
quarter: 25 cents / $0.25
dime: 10 cents / $0.10
nickel: 5 cents / $0.05
penny: 1 cent / $0.01

## :)

- Such a great joke!
- We chose the language and the problem fast
- codespaces worked (not so well, but better than repl.it)
- Goodbye repl!
- 1 dojo, 2 problems, 100 pennies
- Bag of pennies jokes are cool
- Python operator package (using mul to avoid lambda)
- map and generator expressions
- TDD rocks! (to fill time)
- Every week someone bringing challenges


## :(

- Bag of pennies jokes are not cool
- A bag of pennies
- Very simple problems
- We needed to postpone the solutions
- codespaces frozen one time
